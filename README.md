# Chat With YouTube

This web application allows users to interact with YouTube video transcripts and receive real-time conversational responses using the **Google Gemini** API. By providing a video URL, the app fetches the transcript and allows users to ask questions based on the content of the video. The AI (Gemini) responds based on the specific part of the video the user is referencing.

## Features

- **Transcript Retrieval**: Extracts the transcript of a YouTube video.
- **AI-powered Chat**: Allows users to ask questions based on the video content, with responses generated by Google Gemini.
- **Conversational Flow**: The app responds naturally based on the video's context, without unnecessary formalities.
- **Supports Multiple Questions**: Users can ask multiple questions while interacting with the video.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (for installing Python packages)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-codesOP/Chat-With-YouTube.git
   cd Chat-With-YouTube
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash

### Set up Environment Variables

The application uses the **Google Gemini API**. You need to set up the **Google API Key** in the `.env` file.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add your **Google API Key** to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

> **Note**: You can obtain an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
